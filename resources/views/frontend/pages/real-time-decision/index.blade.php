                    <p>Right time decision support system is an information system that aids a business in decision-making activities that require judgment, determination, and a sequence of actions. The information system assists the mid-and high-level management of an organization by analyzing huge volumes of unstructured data and accumulating information that can help to solve problems and help in decision-making. </p>
                    
                    <p>A Right time decision support system produces detailed information reports by gathering and analyzing data. Hence, a Right time decision support system is different from a normal operations application, whose goal is to collect data and not analyze it.</p>
                    
                    <p>In an organization, a Right time decision support system is used by the planning departments – such as the operations department – which collects data and creates a report that can be used by managers for decision-making. Mainly, a Right time decision support system is used in sales projection, for inventory and operations-related data, and to present information to customers in an easy-to-understand manner.</p>
                    
                    <p>Theoretically, a Right time decision support system can be employed in various knowledge domains from an organization to forest management and the medical field. One of the main applications of a Right time decision support system in an organization is real-time reporting. It can be very helpful for organizations that take part in just-in-time inventory management.</p>
                    
                    <p>In a Right time, decision support system, the organization requires real-time data of their inventory levels to place orders “just in time” to prevent delays in production and cause a negative domino effect. A Right time decision support system increases the speed and efficiency of decision-making activities. It is possible, as a Right time decision support system can collect and analyze real-time data. It promotes training within the organization, as specific skills must be developed to implement and run the Right time decision support system within an organization. It automates monotonous managerial processes, which means more of the manager’s time can be spent on decision-making. It improves interpersonal communication within the organization.</p>
